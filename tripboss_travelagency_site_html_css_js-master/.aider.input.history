+what now

# 2025-04-10 14:47:20.476264
+i think we are using only 3 templates, touritsinfo.html contacts.html and gallery.html as the main page so you should remove all other templates which are unnecessary and rename one of the templates to index (may be gallery) so that i do not face that issue when i host in git hub pages if i am right
